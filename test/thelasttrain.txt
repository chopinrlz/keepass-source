The Last Train
It was a cold and rainy night in New York City. Anna had just finished her shift at the diner and was heading home. She walked to the subway station, hoping to catch the last train. She was tired and hungry, and all she wanted was to curl up in her bed and forget about the troubles of the day.
She reached the platform and saw that the train was already there, waiting for the passengers to board. She hurried to the nearest door and stepped inside. The car was almost empty, except for a few people sitting in the corners. Anna found a seat near the window and put her bag on her lap. She looked out the window and saw the raindrops sliding down the glass.
She closed her eyes and tried to relax. She thought about her life and how it had turned out. She had moved to New York from a small town in Ohio, hoping to pursue her dream of becoming a writer. She had always loved reading and writing stories, and she wanted to share them with the world. She had applied to several magazines and publishers, but none of them had accepted her work. She had ended up working as a waitress at a cheap diner, barely making enough money to pay the rent for her tiny apartment.
She felt like a failure. She wondered if she had made a mistake by leaving her home and family. She missed her parents and her younger brother, who had always supported her and encouraged her. She wished she could talk to them and hear their voices. She hadn't called them in a long time, because she was too ashamed to admit that she was struggling. She didn't want them to worry about her or to think that she was unhappy.
She opened her eyes and looked at her watch. It was almost midnight. The train had been moving slowly, stopping at every station. She wondered why it was taking so long. She hoped that she would get home soon. She felt a sudden jolt and heard a loud screech. The train came to a halt. She looked out the window and saw that they were in a dark tunnel. She heard an announcement over the speaker.
"Attention, passengers. We apologize for the inconvenience. There is a technical problem with the train. We are working to fix it as soon as possible. Please remain calm and seated. Thank you for your patience and cooperation."
Anna sighed and rolled her eyes. She was annoyed and frustrated. She wondered how long it would take to fix the problem. She hoped that it wouldn't be too long. She looked around the car and saw that the other passengers were also restless and bored. Some of them were checking their phones, some of them were reading books or magazines, some of them were listening to music or podcasts, and some of them were just staring into space.
Anna felt a sudden chill and shivered. She realized that the air conditioning was still on, and that it was making the car colder. She wished that she had brought a jacket or a sweater. She wrapped her arms around herself and tried to warm up. She looked out the window again and saw that the rain had stopped. She saw a flash of lightning and heard a rumble of thunder. She realized that there was a storm outside. She hoped that it wouldn't affect the train or the power supply.
She closed her eyes again and tried to sleep. She thought that maybe if she slept, the time would pass faster and the problem would be solved. She tried to ignore the noise and the cold and the discomfort. She tried to clear her mind and to relax. She drifted into a light sleep.
She woke up to a loud bang and a bright flash. She opened her eyes and saw that the lights in the car had gone out. She heard screams and shouts. She felt a surge of panic and fear. She wondered what had happened. She looked out the window and saw that the tunnel was on fire. She saw flames and smoke and sparks. She realized that the train had been hit by lightning. She felt a shock of pain and a burst of heat. She smelled burning and melting. She heard another announcement over the speaker.
"Attention, passengers. We regret to inform you that the train has been struck by lightning and has caught fire. We are unable to fix the problem or to move the train. We are sorry to say that there is no way out. We advise you to prepare for the worst. We thank you for choosing our service and we wish you a peaceful end. Goodbye."
Anna gasped and cried. She couldn't believe what she had heard. She couldn't accept that she was going to die. She felt a wave of anger and sadness and regret. She thought about her life and how it had ended. She thought about her dreams and how they had never come true. She thought about her family and how they had never known how much she loved them. She wished that she had done things differently. She wished that she had lived better. She wished that she had said goodbye.
She looked around the car and saw that the other passengers were also in shock and despair. Some of them were praying, some of them were crying, some of them were hugging, and some of them were silent. Anna felt a sudden urge to connect with someone, to share her feelings, to find some comfort. She looked for a friendly face, a kind eye, a warm hand. She saw a man sitting across from her, who was also looking at her. He was young and handsome, with brown hair and green eyes. He smiled at her and reached out his hand. He said to her:
"Hi, I'm Jake. What's your name?"
Anna felt a spark of hope and a flicker of love. She smiled back at him and took his hand. She said to him:
"Hi, I'm Anna. Nice to meet you."
They held hands and looked into each other's eyes. They felt a connection and a bond. They felt like they had known each other for a long time. They felt like they had found each other for a reason. They felt like they had something to live for. They talked to each other and told each other their stories. They laughed and cried and joked and comforted. They forgot about the fire and the smoke and the pain. They focused on the present and the future. They made plans and promises and vows. They decided to escape and to survive and to live. They decided to be together and to be happy and to be free.
They kissed and hugged and whispered. They felt a surge of passion and a burst of joy. They felt alive and grateful and blessed. They made love and celebrated and cherished. They felt the fire and the smoke and the pain fade away. They felt the light and the air and the peace take over. They felt their hearts and souls and bodies unite. They felt their spirits and minds and dreams soar. They felt the train and the tunnel and the world disappear. They felt each other and themselves and nothing else.
They died and lived and loved. They were the last train.
